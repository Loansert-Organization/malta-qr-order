# ICUPA Vendor App Implementation

## Overview
The ICUPA Vendor App has been successfully implemented with a complete management system for bar and restaurant owners. The system allows vendors to manage menus, receive orders, track payments, and update their business profile, all using anonymous authentication for testing.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Vendor Dashboard (`/vendor`)
- **Welcome Header**: Displays bar name with greeting
- **Key Metrics Cards**:

  - Total Sales Today (€ amount)
  - Pending Orders (requiring action)
  - Popular Item (most ordered today)
- **Quick Actions**: Navigate to Orders, Menu Management, Payments, Analytics
- **Real-time Updates**: Live subscription to order changes
- **Auto-initialization**: Creates demo vendor session on first visit

### 2. Orders Management (`/vendor/orders`)
- **Order List**: Today's orders with real-time updates
- **Order Details**:
  - Order ID and timestamp

  - Revolut payment link (Malta)
- **Bar Information Display**:
  - Bar ID
  - Country
  - Active status
- **Save Changes**: Update bar details with loading state

## Database Schema

### Updated Tables:
1. **bars**: Added logo_url, momo_code, revolut_link fields
2. **orders**: Full CRUD with vendor filtering
3. **menus**: Complete menu item management
4. **payments**: Read access for analytics

### Storage Buckets:
1. **menu_images**: Public bucket for menu item photos
2. **bar-logos**: Public bucket for bar/restaurant logos

### RLS Policies:
- Vendors can update their own bar details
- Full CRUD on menu items for their bar
- Update order status for their orders
- Read access to payments for their bar

## Key Technical Features

### Anonymous Vendor Session
```javascript
// Automatically assigns first Malta bar as demo vendor
localStorage.setItem('vendorBarId', barId);
```

### Real-time Subscriptions
```javascript
// Orders update live as customers place them
supabase.channel('vendor-orders')
  .on('postgres_changes', { 
    event: '*', 
    table: 'orders',
    filter: `bar_id=eq.${barId}`
  }, callback)
```

### Image Upload
```javascript
// Direct upload to Supabase Storage
const { data: { publicUrl } } = supabase.storage
  .from('menu_images')
  .getPublicUrl(filePath);
```

### Payment Method Routing
- Rwanda vendors see MoMo configuration
- Malta vendors see Revolut configuration

## Usage Flow

1. **First Visit** → Auto-assigns demo bar from Malta
2. **Dashboard** → View today's performance at a glance
3. **Orders** → Monitor and manage incoming orders
4. **Menu** → Add/edit items, toggle availability
5. **Payments** → Track revenue and export reports
6. **Settings** → Update bar details and payment info

## Testing the Vendor App

2. Dashboard loads with demo bar data
3. Place a test order from client app to see it appear
4. Manage menu items (add, edit, toggle)
5. View payment analytics
6. Update bar settings
